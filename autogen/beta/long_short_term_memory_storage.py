        └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    **Core memory** — singleton block, always fully visible.
    Created on the first session end and updated on every subsequent one.
    Stores stable user identity facts (name, role, preferences, goals).
    Unlike L1/L2 blocks, no ``memory_lookup`` call is needed; the full
    content is always in the context window.

    **L1 short-term memory** — compressed within a session.
    Triggered lazily inside ``get_history`` whenever the raw-event token
    budget exceeds *token_threshold* (by default, ``memory_lookup`` tool
    lines are excluded from that measurement and from L1 ``source_text``).
    On each **lazy** compression, ``memory_lookup`` call/result *events* are
    also dropped from raw history for everything **before** the last
    *recent_turns* user messages; the recent suffix is left intact so the
    model still sees fresh lookups. At **session end**, ``consolidate()``
    flushes **all** remaining raw into a **single** L1 block (again stripping
    ``memory_lookup`` tool events from that summary). L1 blocks exist only for
    the lifetime of the current Python process.

    **L2 long-term memory** — persisted across sessions to a JSON file.
    L2 consolidation is *not* triggered automatically during the session;
    it must be invoked explicitly after the agent task ends::

        # Option A – explicit call
        reply = await agent.ask("hello", stream=stream)
        await storage.consolidate()

        # Option B – async context manager (recommended)
        async with storage.session():
            reply = await agent.ask("hello", stream=stream)
        # consolidation + JSON save happen automatically on exit

    **Minimal usage** — pass only a model *config* and a store path::

        from autogen.beta.config.openai.config import OpenAIConfig
        from autogen.beta.long_short_term_memory_storage import LongShortTermMemoryStorage

        config = OpenAIConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_key="sk-...")
        storage = LongShortTermMemoryStorage(
            config=config,
            l2_store_path="agent_memory.json",
        )

    Built-in default prompts are used for both summarisation and L2
    consolidation.  Pass custom *summarizer* / *consolidator* callables only
    when you need to override the defaults.

    **Custom consolidation logic**

    The consolidator receives all existing L2 blocks, the new L1 blocks, and
    the max-block cap, then returns a compact list of *operations* — only the
    blocks that actually change are mentioned (unchanged blocks are omitted to
    save tokens)::

        async def my_consolidator(
            existing: list[L2MemoryBlock],
            new_l1: list[L1MemoryBlock],

        Parameters

        config:
            Model configuration (e.g. ``OpenAIConfig``) passed to the
            built-in summariser, consolidator, and core memory consolidator.
            Required unless both *summarizer* and *consolidator* are supplied
            explicitly.
        summarizer:
            Optional async callable ``(text: str) -> str`` used for L1
            compression.  When ``None`` a default implementation backed by
            *config* is used.
        consolidator:
            Optional async callable
            ``(existing_l2, new_l1, max_blocks) -> list[L2Operation]``
            that fully controls how L2 blocks are updated at session end.
            When ``None`` a smart LLM-driven default backed by *config* is
            used; if *config* is also ``None`` the built-in simple strategy
            (append / merge-oldest) is used as the final fallback.
        core_consolidator:
            Optional async callable
            ``(current_core: CoreMemoryBlock | None, new_l1: list[L1MemoryBlock]) -> str``
            that rewrites the singleton core memory block at session end.
            When ``None`` a default LLM-driven implementation backed by
            *config* is used; if *config* is also ``None`` the summariser
            is used as a simple fallback.
        l2_store_path:
            Path to a JSON file used to persist memory across sessions.
            L2 blocks, their referenced L1 blocks, and the core memory block
            are all stored here.  L1 blocks that are no longer referenced by
            any L2 block are pruned on each save.
            The file is read on construction (if it exists) and written after
            every successful ``consolidate()`` call.  Pass ``None`` to keep
            all memory in-process only.
        token_counter:
            Optional callable ``(text: str) -> int``.  Defaults to a simple
            character-based heuristic (1 token ≈ 4 characters).
        token_threshold:
            Raw-event token budget that triggers L1 compression (default 10 000).
        max_l2_blocks:
            Hard upper limit on the total number of L2 blocks.
        recent_turns:
            Number of most-recent user/assistant turn pairs kept as raw events
            in the active context window; older turns are compressed into L1.
        l1_ignore_tool_names:
            Tool names whose call and result lines are omitted when measuring
            raw context size for L1 compression and when building L1
            ``source_text`` / summariser input (so large ``memory_lookup``
            payloads do not spuriously trigger compression or get re-summarised
            into a new L1 block).  ``None`` defaults to ``frozenset({"memory_lookup"})``.
            Pass ``frozenset()`` to disable filtering.

        The agent memory is organised into two tiers:

        **L1 blocks (short-term memory)**

          token threshold.  Each L1 block stores a compressed *abstract* and
          the *full raw source text* of the original conversation turns.
          IDs look like ``"L1-a3f8c120"``.

          Calling ``memory_lookup("L1-<id>")`` returns the complete source
          text so you can read the exact conversation that was summarised.

        **L2 blocks (long-term memory)**
          Created at the end of a session by consolidating one or more L1
          blocks into a single consolidated entry that persists across
          sessions.  Each L2 block stores an *abstract* and the list of L1
          block IDs it was built from.
          IDs look like ``"L2-b7e91d04"``.

          Calling ``memory_lookup("L2-<id>")`` returns the IDs and abstracts
          of the underlying L1 blocks.  You can then call
          ``memory_lookup("L1-<id>")`` on any of those to read the full text.

        How to call this tool:
          Pass exactly one argument — the block ID string (e.g.
          ``memory_lookup("L2-b7e91d04")``).  Block IDs are shown in the
          pinned memory header at the top of the conversation context.

        Returns a plain-text string describing the block content, or an error
