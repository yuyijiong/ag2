example_memory_agent.py — How to use LongShortTermMemoryStorage with an ag2-beta Agent
========================================================================================

This file is a self-contained, runnable tutorial.  Set your API key and run:

    python example_memory_agent.py

What the example demonstrates
------------------------------
PART A — Short-term memory (intra-session L1 compression)
  By using a very low token_threshold (500 tokens) and keeping only 2 raw turns,
  the storage compresses early conversation turns into L1 blocks *mid-session*
  as the rolling context grows.  The agent must call memory_lookup() to retrieve
  exact details from those compressed turns — even though the conversation is
  still in progress (no session boundary has been crossed yet).

  This exercises the intra-session compression path independently of L2
  consolidation.

PART B — Long-term memory (cross-session L2 consolidation)
  1. Creating LongShortTermMemoryStorage with just a model config — no custom
     summarizer or consolidator needed; built-in defaults handle both.
  2. Wiring the storage into a MemoryStream.
  3. Giving the agent a memory_lookup tool so it can drill into stored blocks.
  4. Running a multi-turn conversation inside storage.session() so that
     L1/L2/core consolidation and JSON persistence happen automatically at
     session end.
  5. A second session that introduces new personal facts, showing how the
     core memory block evolves across sessions.
  6. A third session that must call memory_lookup to retrieve specific details.
